This is Blue, a low-cost backdrivable 7-DOF robotic manipulator. This website is a companion to our paper (submitted to ICRA/RA-L 2019), and is intended to provide more detail into the technical capabilities of the robot as well as the metrics we used to characterize its performance.

This project was developed at UC Berkeley by a team of researchers from the Robot Learning Lab led by David Gealy, Stephen McKinley, and Pieter Abbeel. This project was made possible by the Bakar Fellows Program, the National Science Foundation, and the Toyota Research Institute.
